            Always in motion during its travels, this fish is not just any ordinary aquatic creature; it is the Henyonme (weird Four-Eyed Fish), an otherworldly being transported here from unknown spans of the universe.

            Its scales hot like lava, but moves like a bolt in the sky, something from legend. It traverses this plane of reality in search of something beyond comprehension. One might assume it would rule the land, as there is no competition for its dominion.

    <div class="text-block"style="text-align:center;">
        <p>
            Yearning for more power, where will this extraordinary beast venture next in this vast, new world.
