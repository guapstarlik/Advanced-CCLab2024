                A battle that would be remembered for centuries, a clash that legends would be forged from. One evening, the Henyonme, a legendary being that hadn't graced this plane of existence in a millennium, made its return at the Golden Falls.            </p>

                Guarding the falls was the Vicious Tiger, a guardian dedicated to its protection. The two engaged in a relentless struggle for days. Although the guardian's kin offered assistance, it proved insufficient as the Henyonme persisted in its unyielding attack.            </p>

                The temples and structures that had held the denizens of the falls, gotten destroyed, leaving more chaos to brew. Suddenly, a monk appeared and cast an enchantment over the two beasts. With a graceful whirl of their arms, the adversaries succumbed to a slumber deeper than rest. Who is this mysterious savior, and what are their intentions?            </p>
