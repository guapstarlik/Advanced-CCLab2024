            The vicious tiger, guardian of the falls watching over its inhabitants maintaining the balance of the area. This lonesome tiger, an offbreed of the Tiger god has chosen the mighty falls as its place of inhabitants because of its close proximity to blossoms of might.

            A mighty flower that blooms producing crystalline petals that can empower a creature. The lust for more is the only reason why this vicious tiger maintains the peace. If anyone were to steal all the blossoms atop the falls then no one could anticipate what would happen.
