                The air is tense as the golden falls, once the tranquil home of the tigers and the sanctuary of the Tiger God, experiences an unusual disturbance. Abruptly, the water in the falls becomes still—an ominous sign that something is amiss.           
              </p>

        <div class="text-block"style="text-align:center;">

                Then, emerging from the depths, appears the Henyonme, the peculiar four-eyed fish—a legendary being that hasn't graced this plane of existence in a millennium. The guardian of the falls immediately springs into action, fiercely protecting its kin. The ensuing battle is destined to become the stuff of legends.
